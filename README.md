# dataanalytics
In this Jupyter notebook I was trying to analyze the relationship between sales of innerwear items and other factors such as pricing and rating. The primary dataset that was used as the base of this project consists
of sales data from Amazon.com for the period of June-July 2017. The methods used include linear regression, polynomial regression, amd multiple regression using logit and probit models. The main libraries used are
pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, statsmodels, and scipy. Also, I identified the most successful brands, colors, and retail platforms for the indicated period. Please, contact me if you notice any errors and have any suggestions via sakhmetova99@gmail.com.
